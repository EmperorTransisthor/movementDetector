For anyone that is interested, I got this working with the following configuration on a fresh install of Raspbian Stretch:

Implement the /boot/config.txt changes that mkshrps suggested by adding "dtoverlay=spi0-cs,cs0_pin=25" to the config.txt record.

Use the following values in board_config
DIO0 = 4
DIO1 = 23
DIO2 = 24
DIO3 = 21
LED = 18
SWITCH = 7

ADD THE FOLLOWING LINES TO constants.py
@add_lookup
class SPI_BAUD_RATE:
MAX_SPEED_HZ = 5000
@add_lookup
class SPI_MODE:
SPI_MODE = 0b01

ADD THE FOLLOWING LINES TO LoRa.py at the top of the class definition right after " spi = BOARD.SpiDev() ":
spi.max_speed_hz = SPI_BAUD_RATE.MAX_SPEED_HZ
spi.mode = SPI_MODE.SPI_MODE

With these changes / additions I was able to get the Dragino Hats talking to each other over the Pi's without having to do any soldering on the Hat.
